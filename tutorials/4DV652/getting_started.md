# Getting started in the project course 4DV652

Hey,

I am going to post a few useful links here to get you started with the most crucial for programming and project management. We recommend you use an agile approach, see [Scrum on one page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504202406/https://scrum-master.de/files/Scrum_on_1_page.pdf). You will be taking all roles, except product owner and stakeholder. It is acceptable to choose a different Scrum master in each sprint, to divide responsibilities over the project's course.

I advise you to use the university's GitLab (<https://gitlab.lnu.se>) for both, storing your code and managing your project. GitLab has [issue-tracking and -management built in](https://web.archive.org/web/20211128185556/https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/plan_and_track.html), and it'll be sufficient for this course (get in touch with *Morgan Ericsson* if you have problems setting up a project/team). If you want to use a different system to manage your project, please use either GitHub Teams, or set up a free project on [Youtrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html#section=incloud) (as of 2022, free up to 10 members). In any case, ***make sure to invite the course's teaching assistants to your projects***, so that we have access to all code and issues. You do not have to use all features of the project management tool, either. Stick with 2, maximal 3 hierarchies of issues (I suggest using Epics/Milestones for each sprint, and then plain issues and/or [work items](https://web.archive.org/web/20211128195953/https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/work_items.html) in each sprint with certain types). Use one sprint per assignment.

Most likely, you will use `git` to manage your code, and to work collaboratively on it. You can stick to the most crucial features of `git`, like commits, branches, merges, etc. You do not have to use `git` on the command line, there is a nice free cross-platform GUI client called [Source Tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20220117140501/https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) that you can use :) Also see the [Git cheat sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20211102141257/https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

I recommend you use virtual machines hosted in the university's own **CS-Cloud**, <https://cscloud.lnu.se/project/>. The cloud is only accessible from within the university's networks. You can even allocate VMs with a GPU (which you should if you train the models not on your own computers). Again, ask Morgan if any problems, he can help :)

As for the technology stack, I recommend you stick with a homogeneous environment, at least for the backend. More concretely, I recommend you use Python, as it covers all our needs (API, ML, and notebooks, for which we recommend to use [Jupyterlab](https://web.archive.org/web/20220119112150/https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)). We will be working with `TensorFlow` (preferably [`Keras`](https://keras.io/)), and you'll find everything you need in Python, like `scikit-learn` and other packages. I do recommend you set up a reproducible environment using any of [`conda`](https://web.archive.org/web/20211226173230/https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [pip/PyPI](https://web.archive.org/web/20220118080050/https://pypi.org/project/pip/), or Python's own [`venv`](https://web.archive.org/web/20220104220745/https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (this is **important for us** so that we can reproduce your results). For the API, you can use
a package like
[Flask](https://web.archive.org/web/20220119083403/https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/) (totally
sufficient). For the frontend, as mentioned also by Welf, use whatever gets your job done (React for example).

If you have any more questions about any of the above, ask the TAs first, we're here to help!
